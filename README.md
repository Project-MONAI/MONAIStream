MONAI Stream is an open-source framework that enables fast research prototyping
for real-time streaming applications for medical imaging. The software abstracts
the details of frame capture, data transfer, and inference techniques in an
optimized and easy to use Python API wrapper.

MONAI Stream supports Linux x86 PCs with NVIDIA GPUs, and Clara AGX Developer
Kit in dGPU configuration.
